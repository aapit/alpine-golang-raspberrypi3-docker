# Docker image for Go 1.10 on Alpine, for Raspberry Pi 3 (ARMv7)

Because Resin OS doesn't offer any version of Alpine-Golang higher than Go 1.8 at the moment, this is a practical base image to build upon.
Docker Hub does not compile on ARM, so this will have to be built on a compatible CPU architecture.
